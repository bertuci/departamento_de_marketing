•  One of the crucial points of marketing is getting to know customers and identifying their needs

• Understanding consumers, we can send specific campaigns for specific needs

• If customer data is available, we can apply Data Science to segment the market

# PROBLEM

## • We were hired by a NYC bank to analyze the data and divide customers into at least 3 groups


### Let's use the K-MEANS algorithm

some information about the algorithm:

• Unsupervised algorithm (clustering)

• Records are grouped based on similar attributes, by calculating Euclidean Distance



And to define the number of clusters we use the elbow method

### We will also use the PCA algorithm

some information about the algorithm:

• PCA is an unsupervised learning algorithm

• Applies dimensionality reduction, however, tries to keep the original information with the same characteristics

• Finds a new set of features that are called components

• Components are created using uncorrelated characteristics

### We also use autoencoder

some information about the algorithm:

• They are a type of artificial neural networks to encode data

• Uses the same input and output to compare results
